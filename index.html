<div style="text-align: justify">
This research, led by a PhD student at AILab, <b>Henry Yang</b>, and advised by the Lab director, <b>Dr. Hsinchun Chen</b>, focuses on building a model that automatically summarizes environment, social, and governance (ESG) concerns for each company with <b>HuggingChat</b> and generate <b>ESG action plans</b> by fine-tuning a <b>llama 2 model</b> and applying <b>actor-critic-based reinforcement learning algorithms</b>, recognizing the industry's rising concerns on their ESG scores today.
<br /> <br />
I, as a research assistant, am cfocusing on data mining and analysis using Python and different packages including <b>selenium, BeautifulSoup, </b>etc. Also, based on my biligual ability, I identified both Korean and English-written websites from which the team would collect data.

This research team, lead by a PhD student at AILab, <b>Amy Fang</b>, and advised by the AILab director, <b>Dr. Hsinchun Chen</b>, and an assistant professor at the University of Georgia, <b>Weifeng Li</b>, focuses on finding efficient means to protect end-users' confidential infomration online by alayzing <b>privacy policies</b>, leaked <b>personally identifiable information (PII)</b> on both dark and surface webs, and coming up with viable solutions to address the <b>privacy paradox</b> within the end-users. Our team's projects aim to protect the most vulnerable ones on the internet and find ways to help companies abide with the most recent privacy regulations by implementing automated model to analyze and update privacy policies so that the users find it easier to understand the policies.
<br /> <br />
I, as a research assistant, am contributing to this team by collecting data from different dark web hacker platforms where the leaked PII are being shared among the hackers. I also contribute to orgazing and analyzing data. Under supervision, I continuously conduct rigorous literature reviews to develop my research skills and develop my understanding in the field.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Our team conducted research on COVID-19 misinformation detection, utilizing three datasets totaling 1.6 million tweets and employing various classification methods, including <b>machine learning, deep learning, and ChatGPT</b>. We found that the <b>support vector machine (SVM) model</b> yielded the best overall performance in detecting misinformation related to the pandemic.

<div style="text-align: justify">
For this project, I investigated the determinants of 4-year undergraduate institution's graduation rates. As a <b>data analyst</b> of the team, I cleaned the dataset and ran different prediction models to identify statistically significant variables impacting the rates using data analysis tools and statistics. We discovered that in-state tution and living expense increases correlate with higher graudation rates in public institutions, while private institutions consistently maintain higher graduation rates. We also found trends related to religious affiliations and city sizes, indicating potential areas for further research to enhance graduation rates.
